README

This is a temporary file to help get people started with SBayesR. It is based off
code from Chandra Reynolds, but some components were not needed to test SBayesR on 
the EF summary statistics from Hatoum et al. (2023) in CATSLife.

I will provide an updated file sometime soon, but please reach out if you need 
help using SBayesR on CATSLife data in the meantime!
