README

Updated: 11/27/2023

This folder includes example scripts for PRScs, using both ABCD and CATSLife data. 
Relevant files are located on the RC server.

In most cases, you will be able to call PRScs from the existing directory inside Dan's 
folder. However, some file paths will need to be updated to your directory
(e.g., locations of the sumstats, etc.).
